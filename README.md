# ticketing

On the frontend, I use React and Next JS to present content to users.
The backend is built on an event-based architecture.
Each service is created using Node and Express.
Data for each service is held in Mongo database.
The entire app is deployed and runs in Docker containers executed in a Kubernetes cluster.
Finally, almost all of the code is written with Typescript.
